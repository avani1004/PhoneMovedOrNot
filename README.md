# PhoneMovedOrNot
It is an app created in Android Studio that tells you if the phone was moved. When you start the app, it waits 30 seconds
before starting to detect motion. Then, it remembers if someone has moved the phone. When you get back and use the phone again, it tells you whether the phone has been
moved. It uses TYPE_ACCELEROMETER to capture the movement of the phone.
